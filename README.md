# Labor
---

Are you feeling very terrible when you want to execute some extra operation asynchronously
(like sending a email or a HTTP request to a callback URL) after your basic operation run successfully,
but you don't want to implement this feature by multi-threading or fork a new process?

**labor** is your good choice to solve it!

**labor** is a lightweight `serivce-framework` to finished to **EXTRA OPERATION**. It's asynchronously,
fast!
